### Spring Boot User Registration & Login
This project demonstrates how to implement user registration and login authentication using Spring Boot.

I built this project by following a YouTube tutorial to better understand how user registration and login work.

Features
- User registration with validation
- Password hashing with Spring Security
- User login and authentication
- Login failure handling
- Simple UI for signup & login
- Persistent storage using a relational database (H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
